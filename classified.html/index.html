Leaders were determined by the strongest in <em>gladiatorial competitions</em> and that leader rules with absolute authority.</p><p>The kingdom of <em>Reptilians</em> was controlled for many millions of years by <em>Santan</em> (immortal) who was definitely the strongest of the <em>Reptilians</em>, but also reinforced his rule through tricks and manipulation when challenged because he is also one of the most intelligent.</p><h3>Age of Resistance:</h3><p>A new groups started forming inside the kingdom known as the ancient ones to the <em>Blears</em>. Basically small <em>rodent like creatures</em> much smaller than <em>Blears</em> started forming an underground movement that gave a place for the <em>Blears</em> to start gaining a foothold. A belief in their highest potential form develops known as <em>“Dog”</em>.</p><h3>Age of <em>Blears</em>:</h3><p> <em>Blears</em> were spawned and completely obliterated the entire society of <em>Reptilians</em> pushing what was left of them to the <em>north hold</em> which is basically an underground layer where the Reptilians could survive the harsh climate due to volcanic activity. <em>The North Hole</em> has been turned is a hellish version of <em>Santa</em>’s village..</p><p><em>Blear society</em> thrived and became much like modern humans of the 1950’s with more advanced technology that borders on some mysterious magic. Almost everything that has happened in our world has happened in there world, but it was <em>Blears</em> who did it instead. Humans in their dimension are basically wild animals.</p><h3>Modern:</h3><p><em>Santan</em> locked away in the <em>North Hole</em> for a couple million years starts hatching a plan with stolen <em>Blear</em> technology..</p><p><em>Santan</em> first starts by building an interdimensional portal and forming an alliance with humans of a different dimension to dominate their world for shared benefit thus setting a trap for the <em>Blears</em> to be sprung..</p><p><em>Santan</em> then casts a core group of some of the most powerful <em>Blears</em> in an attempt to devastate the <em>Blear</em> society in their dimension and to hopefully put those core <em>Blears</em> into a battleground which <em>Santan</em> controls.</p><p>Santan made a mistake and accidently cast the blears into a weird sea creature on the bottom of what used to be an ocean being swallowed up by <em>StEW?? INC.</em>’s mobile eatr factories which in the process release the Blears from that creature and then canned them causing them to be tossed out the back to explode thus forever changing the corporate landscape of <em>StEW??? INC</em>...</p><p><em>Blarist Stewington</em> is a stew mogul born the 1980’s from a long line of stew moguls stretching back to other major moguls the likes of Rockefeller, Morgan, and Carnegie. <em>StEW?? INC</em> was founded by his great, great grandfather <em>Billist Stewington</em>.</p><p><em>“Stew Inc.”</em> lost many lawsuits due to massive corporate negligence for a hundred years causing the company to be called <em>“Stew? Inc.”</em> with a clear warning on the label that stated “<em>Probably not stew. May contain industrial waste products.</em>” Regardless of the countless lawsuits on the <em>Stew? Inc.</em>, the stew monopoly could not be stopped due to its infiltration into the global economy.</p><p>Overnight <em>Blarist</em>’s factories were overrun by these creatures driving him mad with their incessant demands for complete nonsense. He went from being one of the most sought after and elegant bachelors in the world to a complete hedonist within a matter of weeks.. From tuxedos to a smoking jacket and a speedo. From neatly kept to shaggy.. From highly polished socially to down right vulgar and intensely sexually suggestive..</p><p>The <em>Blears</em> have thus basically taken over <em>StEW?? INC</em>. and have slowly started morphing into their classified meming operation in the attempts to thwart the <em>Illuminati</em> and <em>Santan</em>’s control over the human population due to the ineffective leadership which is just skirting disaster at any moment due to the <em>Blears</em> naivety of their surrounding world.</p><p>We are now currently in the midst of The Great Meme <em>Wars</em> where these two factions are battling for the hearts and minds of humans at large..</p></article></main> <script src="/src.c188d5b9.js"></script><div><canvas width="800" height="600" style="width:800px;height:600px"></canvas></div> </body></html>
